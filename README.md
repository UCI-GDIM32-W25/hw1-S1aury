# HW1
## W1L2 In-Class Activity

Put your notes from the W1L2 (Thurs, Jan 9) in-class activity here.

## Devlog
Prompt: Include the HW1 break-down exercise you wrote during the Week 1 - Lecture 2 (Jan 9) in-class activity (above). If you did not attend and perform this activity, review the lecture slides and write your own plan for how you believe HW1 should be built. If your initially proposed plan turned out significantly different than the activity answers given by Prof Reid, you may want to note what was different. Then, write about how the plan you wrote in the break-down connects to the code you wrote. Cite specific class names and method names in the code and GameObjects in your Unity Scene.


Write your Devlog here!
When I started writing HW1, I thought I really needed some brief review to go back over the last quater's content. When I started working on the code, I knew in my head what the general programming logic looked like, but by the time I wrote it I forgot a lot of the details, such as: how should transform position get the player's position in code? The player moves by pressing buttons, but how does that translate to the player moving across the screen, etc.? So I think this moderately difficult assignment is perfect for a beginner in code like me.
Especially when I was writing how to generate seeds at the player's feet, I had the problem that pressing space didn't respond, and then when I was checking the code I realized that I had forgotten to call the code for the player pressing space in update, which reminded me of the importance of calls in C#.
