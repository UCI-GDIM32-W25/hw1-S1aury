# HW1
## W1L2 In-Class Activity

Put your notes from the W1L2 (Thurs, Jan 9) in-class activity here.

## Devlog
When I started writing HW1, I thought I really needed some brief review to go back over the last quater's content. When I started working on the code, I knew in my head what the general programming logic looked like, but by the time I wrote it I forgot a lot of the details, such as: how should transform position get the player's position in code? The player moves by pressing buttons, but how does that translate to the player moving across the screen, etc.? So I think this moderately difficult assignment is perfect for a beginner in code like me.
Especially when I was writing how to generate seeds at the player's feet, I had the problem that pressing space didn't respond, and then when I was checking the code I realized that I had forgotten to call the code for the player pressing space in update, which reminded me of the importance of calls in C#.

## Prof comments
I unfortunately cannot give this Devlog full marks because you did not include your in-class activity, and your Devlog does not address the prompt! It seems like you wrote a Devlog according to last quarter's instructions without reading the prompt for the Devlog for this assignment. Please make sure to read the HW2 Devlog prompt and to address it super clearly.

Also, you can remove the prompt text. This will make it a lot easier for me to read.

For your next Devlog, see the [README formatting guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to help you format your break-down activity well.
